> A business process is a collection of linked tasks that find their end in the delivery of a service or product to a client. A business process has also been
> defined as a set of activities and tasks that, once completed, will accomplish an organizational goal. The process must involve clearly defined inputs and a
> single output. These inputs are made up of all of the factors that contribute (either directly or indirectly) to the added value of a service or product. These
> factors can be categorized into management processes, operational processes, and supporting business processes.
