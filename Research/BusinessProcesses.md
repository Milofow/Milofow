# Business Processes  

## What is a business process? 
Appian explains it as the following:
> A business process is a collection of linked tasks that find their end in the delivery of a service or product to a client. A business process has also been
> defined as a set of activities and tasks that, once completed, will accomplish an organizational goal. The process must involve clearly defined inputs and a
> single output. These inputs are made up of all of the factors that contribute (either directly or indirectly) to the added value of a service or product. These
> factors can be categorized into management processes, operational processes, and supporting business processes.

## How does business processes relate to software applications? 
Well nowadays a lot of work that used to be done by people can be done by computers. Meaning if you have a clear vision of your business process(es) there are probably some steps that can be replaced by a computer doing it, saving money in the long run. It's also the other way around a lot of software applications are fulfilling a business process. Let's find some more similarities





## Context regarding next questions
The next questions are relatable to my current two projects: individual and group project. I'm going to give some context about them so the questions are more understandable.

### Group project
As a group we have to create a menu application that cuts the interaction with a waiter. The customer has to scan a qr code in the restaurant to navigate to the menu online. From there on customers can view the menu and order. After their order the food and/or drinks will be delivered to their table.

## Does your software automate a task, facilitate a task, or make a new task possible to perform? 
Our software as a group automates the following tasks: giving out menus to guests which is now down by the guests self by scanning the qr code on their table. But also the waiter/waitress coming by to take their order. From the guests perspective it facilitates the order task, because guests can simply order directly from the menu instead of waiting for a waiter/waitress to tell them. This whole process makes it possible to facilitate the payment task aswell, guests could simply pay with their phone as it cuts out the waiter/waitress part again.

## Which is the process that your software supports/automates? Can you visualize it in a diagram?


## Which roles are involved in this process? The work of which people (their roles) will this software influence? 


## Which steps of the process does your software support/automate? Can you visualize this in a diagram?
