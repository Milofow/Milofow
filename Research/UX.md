# UX design and testing

## Introduction
In semester 3 I have to create a project with my group for the company Mediaan. Here's some context about the company provided by them:

> Mediaan is an international IT company, founded in Heerlen, the Netherlands, in 1969. We are in Heerlen, Amsterdam, Düsseldorf, München and Brussel. We believe
> that technology can make a difference in every company. Using smart processes and the newest technologies, companies can connect, inspire and grow.  
> 
> We deliver technology ranging from mobile apps to back-end services. Quality is of the utmost importance to us and our designs are unique. As soon as customers
> are interested in collaborating with Mediaan, but aren't sure of the feasibility of a project, Mediaan will offer a Proof of Concept. Currently, Mediaan has an
> idea for restaurants. However, this can only be realised with limited budget. Therefor Mediaan turns to students.  


They turned to us for creating the next project:

> The process in a restaurant is usually the same. Customers get seated, are hand over the menu, order drinks and food, consume the drinks and food and finally
> have
> dessert. A restaurant has a new idea to convert the above process to a digital experience. You will be developing the requested proof of concept in an agile
> fashion. Initially you'll focus on the MVP (the most important features) and then continue to flesh out the application.

## Design
Currently we're working on the next user story: ```As staff I want to be able to see the bill history``` and this document is going to focus on the design for that user story.

For testing purposes I made an interactive prototype in Adobe XD to do usability tests with.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><img width="934" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73555911/147964798-021ead7e-2682-4c6f-a10c-f7d6f9a9272d.png"></td>
  </tr>
</table>

<br>

Aside from the usability tests, I'm also going to do an A/B test, so I created an extra screen from the prototype to let my subject prefer one.
<table>
  <tr>
    <td><img width="1440" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73555911/147965828-463fe25b-d758-4aa7-ad85-b239321a4a0c.png"></td> 
    <td><img width="1440" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73555911/147965975-382cf42e-789c-4060-8926-29791a82d386.png"></td> 
  </tr>
 </table>

## Testing
Here I'll be describing different durability test methods with their results.

### (Un)Moderated usability testing
I chose moderated testing over unmoderated, so that I can quickly intervene if necessary. It also gives me the opportunity to ask more relevant questions in the process. I designed a prototype to simulate the task that my subjects will need to complete. The task that I will be using is the following:

Dutch:
> Je bent de eigenaar van een buurt cafe, speciaal voor de feestdagen hebben jullie op oudejaarsdag zoetigheid en champagne geserveerd. Je ontvangt van Lucy, een
> werknemer, een berichtje waarin staat dat ze niet zeker weet of de champagne van de gasten op de bon staat. 
> Je logt in op het beheerders portaal om dit te checken en navigeert naar de geschiedenis van de bonnen. 
> Aan jou om uit te zoeken of de champagne wel goed op de bon van tafel nummer 1 staat. 
> Belangrijk is dat je filtert op de volgende data 21 december 2021 tot 31 december 2021.


English:
> You own a little café in the neighbourhood. For the holidays you have special sweet treats and deluxe champagne on the menu. 
> Today you receive a text from one of your employee's, lucy, she worries that the bottle of champagne is not on the receipt for table 1. 
> To make sure that everything is right, you decide to log into the admin portal and search the receipt history. 
> You have to find the receipt from table 1 to check if everything is correct. Keep in mind that you have to filter on these dates: 21st until 31st of december. 


#### Questions for the participants after completing the task
1. How long did it take? (<i> I will time how long it takes to complete the task </i>)

2. Did you experience any frustration during your task? 
If so on a scale from 0 to 10, 0 being not frustrated at all and 10 being frustrated at every step.

3. How was your overall feeling completing your task?
From a scale from 0 to 10, being 0 very unpleasant and 10 being extremely pleasant 

4. Did the program work effectively? did it feel like you could complete the task fast and simple?

5. Were you confused at any time, if so where?







### Session recording
I combined the method above with recording the task, so I can evaluate the user's behavior






Knowing how to adjust the design and functionality to suit your end-users?

Knowing how to design an corporate identity for the webpage in accordance with your client of the digital identity of your product.

Knowing how to design a flow that will stimulate the end-user the follow the path that will reach the business goals of the application.
