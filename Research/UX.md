# UX design and testing

## Introduction
In semester 3 I have to create a project with my group for the company Mediaan. Here's some context about the company provided by them:

> Mediaan is an international IT company, founded in Heerlen, the Netherlands, in 1969. We are in Heerlen, Amsterdam, Düsseldorf, München and Brussel. We believe
> that technology can make a difference in every company. Using smart processes and the newest technologies, companies can connect, inspire and grow.  
> 
> We deliver technology ranging from mobile apps to back-end services. Quality is of the utmost importance to us and our designs are unique. As soon as customers
> are interested in collaborating with Mediaan, but aren't sure of the feasibility of a project, Mediaan will offer a Proof of Concept. Currently, Mediaan has an
> idea for restaurants. However, this can only be realised with limited budget. Therefor Mediaan turns to students.  


They turned to us for creating the next project:

> The process in a restaurant is usually the same. Customers get seated, are hand over the menu, order drinks and food, consume the drinks and food and finally have
> dessert. A restaurant has a new idea to convert the above process to a digital experience. You will be developing the requested proof of concept in an agile
> fashion. Initially you'll focus on the MVP (the most important features) and then continue to flesh out the application.  


## Design
Currently we're working on the next user story: ```As staff I want to be able to see the bill history``` and this document is going to focus on the design for that user story.

For testing purposes I made an interactive prototype in Adobe XD to do usability tests with. 




## Testing
Here I'll be describing different durability test methods with their results.

### (Un)Moderated usability testing
I chose moderated testing over unmoderated, so that I can quickly intervene if necessary. It also gives me the opportunity to ask more relevant questions in the process.


### Session recording
I combined the method above with recording the session, so I can take a look at accuring problems
