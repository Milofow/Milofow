# Agile Research
To deepen my knowledge about the agile work way I'm going to answer some questions about agile and discuss some of the methods and my experience with them.

<br>

## What does it mean agile development, the agile manifesto, the agile principles?

### Agile development
To answer this question I'm first going to discuss what the word "agile" means the dictionary website says the following:

> quick and well-coordinated in movement; lithe:

This gives us a better picture of agile development. If we dig a little deeper and more specific we find a website dedicated to this principle. Agile Alliance as it's called is a non profit community of volunteers to help inform people about this principle and help people get the best out of it. They explain agile development as the following:

> It’s really about thinking through how you can understand what’s going on in the environment that you’re in today, identify what uncertainty you’re facing, and  > figure out how you can adapt to that as you go along.

So agile development is a development process that has room for adjusting or just doing things different while still developing a product. Agile development has a lot of tools to help you develop through this way.

### Agile manifesto
Aside these tools there is also the agile manifesto it is created by 17 people to help other people use agile by doing and helping them do it. This pieces is taken from the manifesto and explains some of its meaning:

> **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools
> 
> **Working software** over comprehensive documentation
> 
> **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation
> 
> **Responding to change** over following a plan

The agile manifesto is based on 12 principles that can be found [here](https://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html). These principles help achieve an agile mindset by letting them guide you. Two good sites that explain these 12 principles are:

## Which agile methods exist and which are most popular?
Below are listed most of the agile methods that exists now a day with a short introduction:

- ### Scrum
> People often think scrum and agile are the same thing because scrum is centered around continuous improvement, which is a core principle of agile. However, scrum
> is a framework for getting work done, where agile is a mindset. You can’t really “go agile”, as it takes dedication from the whole team to change the way they
> think about delivering value to your customers. But you can use a framework like scrum to help you start thinking that way and to practice building agile
> principles into your everyday communication and work.
> 
> The scrum framework is heuristic; it’s based on continuous learning and adjustment to fluctuating factors. It acknowledges that the team doesn’t know everything
> at the start of a project and will evolve through experience. Scrum is structured to help teams naturally adapt to changing conditions and user requirements,
> with re-prioritization built into the process and short release cycles so your team can constantly learn and improve.

- ### Kanban

- ### Adaptive software development (ASD)
- ### Feature driven development (FDD)
- ### Agile Unified process (AUP)




## Can you explain Scrum in full details, as it is by the book?



## Can you explain two more agile methods and name a number of interesting features in them different from Scrum? 

### Kanban
Kanban is a way of organising your tasks on a board. The simplest form is to divide your tasks into three stages: to do, in progress and done. This way you can get a good overview in just a glance. 


## Do you know how software engineers work in practice with agile methods? (to answer this question, we advise that you arrange a visit to a company)
In our group project we repeatedly talked with Timothy our product owner. He told us about their way of working which involves the scrum method with a big kanban board with also more stages like blocked which is a stage if a task cannot be completed because of external factors. They also worked with pair programming from time to time, but mainly in sprints with tasks on the kanban board. The tasks are linked to a user story and are very specific.

## Which agile management tool would you recommend for use in your project and why?
I would always recommend to make use of Kanban it's a great start for your project and it's very clear while working on tasks for yourself as well as in a team. For bigger project also include scrum
