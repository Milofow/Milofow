# Agile Research
To deepen my knowledge about the agile work way I'm going to answer some questions about agile and discuss some of the methods and my experience with them.

<br>

## What does it mean agile development, the agile manifesto, the agile principles?

### Agile development
To answer this question I'm first going to discuss what the word "agile" means the dictionary website says the following:

> quick and well-coordinated in movement; lithe:

<i> Source: https://www.dictionary.com/browse/agile </i>

This gives us a better picture of agile development. If we dig a little deeper and more specific we find a website dedicated to this principle. Agile Alliance as it's called is a non profit community of volunteers to help inform people about this principle and help people get the best out of it. They explain agile development as the following:

> It’s really about thinking through how you can understand what’s going on in the environment that you’re in today, identify what uncertainty you’re facing, and  > figure out how you can adapt to that as you go along.

So agile development is a development process that has room for adjusting or just doing things different while still developing a product. Agile development has a lot of tools to help you develop through this way.

<br>

### Agile manifesto
Aside these tools there is also the agile manifesto it is created by 17 people to help other people use agile by doing and helping them do it. This pieces is taken from the manifesto and explains some of its meaning:

> **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools
> 
> **Working software** over comprehensive documentation
> 
> **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation
> 
> **Responding to change** over following a plan

<br>

The agile manifesto is based on 12 principles that can be found [here](https://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html). These principles help achieve an agile mindset by letting them guide you. Two good sites that explain these 12 principles are:

## Which agile methods exist and which are most popular?
Below are listed most of the agile methods that exists now a day. They contain a short introduction that I picked from the internet that described it the best in my opinion.

- ### Scrum
> People often think scrum and agile are the same thing because scrum is centered around continuous improvement, which is a core principle of agile. However, scrum
> is a framework for getting work done, where agile is a mindset. You can’t really “go agile”, as it takes dedication from the whole team to change the way they
> think about delivering value to your customers. But you can use a framework like scrum to help you start thinking that way and to practice building agile
> principles into your everyday communication and work.
> 
> The scrum framework is heuristic; it’s based on continuous learning and adjustment to fluctuating factors. It acknowledges that the team doesn’t know everything
> at the start of a project and will evolve through experience. Scrum is structured to help teams naturally adapt to changing conditions and user requirements,
> with re-prioritization built into the process and short release cycles so your team can constantly learn and improve.

- ### Kanban
> Kanban is a visual system for managing work as it moves through a process. Kanban visualizes both the process (the workflow) and the actual work passing through
> that process. The goal of Kanban is to identify potential bottlenecks in your process and fix them so work can flow through it cost-effectively at an optimal
> speed or throughput.

- ### Extreme Programming (XP)
> Extreme programming is a software development methodology that’s part of what’s collectively known as agile methodologies. XP is built upon values, principles,
> and practices, and its goal is to allow small to mid-sized teams to produce high-quality software and adapt to evolving and changing requirements.

<img width="314" src="https://d112uwirao0vo9.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Extreme-Programming-XP.jpg">

> What sets XP apart from the other agile methodologies is that XP emphasizes the technical aspects of software development. Extreme programming is precise about
> how engineers work since following engineering practices allows teams to deliver high-quality code at a sustainable pace.
>
> Extreme programming is, in a nutshell, about good practices taken to an extreme. Since pair-programming is good, let’s do it all of the time. Since testing early > is good, let’s test before the production code is even written.

- ### Lean (software) development
> Lean Software Development (LSD) is an agile framework based on optimizing development time and resources, eliminating waste, and ultimately delivering only what
> the product needs. The Lean approach is also often referred to as the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) strategy, in which a team releases a bare-minimum version of
> its product to the market, learns from users what they like, don’t like and want to be added, and then iterates based on this feedback.

<br>

- ### Crystal
> Unlike more fixed frameworks like scrum, crystal recognizes that different teams will perform differently depending on team size, criticality, and priority of
> the project and encourages users to adapt the framework for their individual situation.
> 
> For example, a small team can keep itself aligned with regular communication, so it doesn't need much status reporting and documentation, whereas a large team is
> likely to get out-of-sync and would benefit from a more structured approach.

- ### Agile modeling
> When you want the ultimate definition of any concept, you can’t do better than going right to the source. AgileModeling defines Agile modeling as “…a practice
> based methodology for effective modeling and documentation of software-based systems. Simply put, Agile Modeling (AM) is a collection of values, principles, and
> practices for modeling software that can be applied on a software development project in an effective and lightweight manner.”
> 
> The modeling adds to existing Agile methodologies such as the Rational Unified Process (RUP) or extreme programming (XP). Agile modeling helps developers create
> a customized software development process that fulfills their development needs yet is flexible enough to adjust to future situations.

<br>

- ### Adaptive software development (ASD)
> In ASD, projects happen in an iterative cycle composed of three overlapping phases: speculation, collaboration, and learning. The “speculation” phase is what is
> usually called “planning” in other methodologies, agile or not. It explicitly acknowledges the paradox of making plans in a rapid-evolving, complex, scenario.
> 
> The collaboration phase shows the importance of closer and constant collaboration, not only within the development team, but also between developers and the end
> users of the software.
> 
> Finally, the learning phase indicates everyone involved in the software development process will be continuously learning throughout the project.
> 
> ASD, as an approach, is oriented toward high-speed: it uses techniques such as time-boxed iterative cycles, risk-driven planning and concurrency to achieve quick
> delivery of value to the customer, while also embracing the uncertainty and near-chaos that are intrinsic to complex, high-risk projects.

- ### Feature driven development (FDD)
> FDD is a methodology broadly regarded as based on the four agile values and the twelve agile principles as set out in the Agile Manifesto. It was one of 6
> methodologies represented at the meeting that created the Agile Manifesto.
> 
> Work starts with building a domain object model and identifying all the features and feature sets (groups of features). After prioritizing the features, work
> proceeds iteratively and incrementally.
> 
> The combination of more traditional planning with agile build practices helps FDD fit in with traditional enterprise structures.
> 
> It works well for large teams and long, complex projects.

- ### Rational unified process (RUP)
> Rational Unified Process (RUP) is an agile software development methodology. RUP splits the project life cycle into four phases. During each of the phases, all
> six core development disciplines take place: business modelling, requirements, analysis and design, implementation, testing, and deployment. However, certain
> processes are more important and take up more time during every stage. For example, business modelling mostly takes place during the early phases, inception and
> elaboration. Each of four phases has the main objective, which has to be completed before the project can progress to the next phase.
> 
> The main goal of RUP is to create high quality software with a predictable budget and time frame. Each of the life cycle phases can be repeated, if needed, until
> the main objectives are met. Once the transition stage is completed successfully, the project is finished.

The first three of this list are the most popular agile methodologies, during my research they were mentioned everywhere. The most of them are also the base for other lesser known methodologies.

## Can you explain Scrum in full details, as it is by the book?



## Can you explain two more agile methods and name a number of interesting features in them different from Scrum? 

- ### Extreme programming (XP)

- ### Kanban
Kanban is a way of organising your tasks on a board. The simplest form is to divide your tasks into three stages: to do, in progress and done. This way you can get a good overview in just a glance. 


## Do you know how software engineers work in practice with agile methods?
In our group project we repeatedly talked with Timothy, our product owner. He told us about their way of working which involves the scrum method with a big kanban board with alot more stages then we are using. Their team used stages like blocked, which is a stage for tasks that cannot be completed because of external factors. They also worked with pair programming from time to time, but mainly in sprints with tasks on the kanban board. The tasks are linked to a user story and are very specific.

## Which agile management tool would you recommend for use in your project and why?
I would always recommend to make use of Kanban it's a great start for your project and it's very clear while working on tasks for yourself as well as in a team. For bigger project also include scrum
