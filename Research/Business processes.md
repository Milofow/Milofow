# Business processes  

## What is a business process? 
Appian explains it as the following:
> A business process is a collection of linked tasks that find their end in the delivery of a service or product to a client. A business process has also been
> defined as a set of activities and tasks that, once completed, will accomplish an organizational goal. The process must involve clearly defined inputs and a
> single output. These inputs are made up of all of the factors that contribute (either directly or indirectly) to the added value of a service or product. These
> factors can be categorized into management processes, operational processes, and supporting business processes.

## How does business processes relate to software applications? 
Well nowadays a lot of work that used to be done by people can be done by computers. Meaning if you have a clear vision of your business process(es) there are probably some steps that can be replaced by a computer doing it, saving money in the long run. It's also the other way around a lot of software applications are fulfilling a business process.

## Context group project regarding next questions
As a group we have to create a menu application that cuts the interaction with a waiter. The customer has to scan a qr code in the restaurant to navigate to the menu online. From there on customers can view the menu and order. After their order the food and/or drinks will be delivered to their table. These orders need to be send to a dashboard inside the kitchen, where the personel can label orders as: in progress or done. This helps the workflow as they can clearly keep track of the progression of all orders. At this part of the application it's also possible to edit the menu and inventory. The last one for keeping track of all their products being used.

## Does your software automate a task, facilitate a task, or make a new task possible to perform? 
Our software as a group automates the following tasks: giving out menus to guests which is now down by the guests self by scanning the qr code on their table. But also the waiter/waitress coming by to take their order. From the guests perspective it facilitates the order task, because guests can simply order directly from the menu instead of waiting for a waiter/waitress to tell them. Inside the kitchen it eases tracking orders and inventory. The guest process makes it possible to facilitate the payment task aswell, guests could simply pay with their phone as it cuts out the waiter/waitress part again.

## Which is the process that your software supports/automates? Can you visualize it in a diagram?
The ordinary process of guests arriving at a restaurant, getting seated by someone, receiving the menu, a waiter/waitress stopping by to get their order, their food arriving and finally paying for their meal and leaving. Some steps in the process could be repeated like ordering multiple times, therefore automatically getting their meals brought to the table. This process might look like this:

Due to our software the process now looks like this:

As you can see the personels workload significantly decreases by automating certain tasks and making other ones easier to perform.

## Which roles are involved in this process? The work of which people (their roles) will this software influence? 
In the image above you can see three different roles:

* ### Guest
In the diagram from the previous question the guest has three more steps to perform to reach its end goal. On the contrary the guest benefits from this process because of the following reason: there are less waiting times, the guest can order when he/she wants and doesn't have to wait for the personel.  

* ### Personel
The personel has a two steps less to perfom meaning they will have less work to do, therefore less personel is needed.

* ### Chef
The chef's work stays the same he/she still needs to prepare the order, but we're also not trying to improve something here.

## Which steps of the process does your software support/automate? Can you visualize this in a diagram? 
The tasks crossed from the original process are the ones automated through our software

* Bring menu
This task is now replaced by an action guests can perform by themself, namely scanning the QR code opens the menu.

* Take order
The guests can order directly from their online menu, the order will then arrive at the kitchen. The software cuts out the middle man, in this case the personel.
