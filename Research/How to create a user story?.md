# How to create a user story?
This question will be useful, because I've noticed that working with user stories is worth your while. 
Therefore I want to dig into it to prepare me for making excellent user stories in the future.

## What is a user story?
A user story is a great way to in kaart brengen your functionality from the product you are developing. 
A user story tells what a certain person wants to do to achieve something or solve a problem. 

Another way to look at what a user story is, is from the next definition brought by Andrii Bondarenko in his article on [Stormotion](https://stormotion.io/blog/how-to-write-a-good-user-story-with-examples-templates/):
> User Story is a small (actually, the smallest) piece of work that represents some value to an end user and can be delivered during a sprint.
  
   
   

## How to use user stories?



## Why user stories?



## How to form a user story?
A simple template to create a user story with, is the following:
> As < persona >,    
> I want < what? >  
> so that < why? >.

As they show in the template it's more of a persona then a user, because it could be anybody. 
To start forming correct user stories you need to make sure you know this persona. As this piece of an article explains: 

> If you don’t know who the users and customers are and why they would want to use the product, then you should not write any user stories. Carry out the necessary user research first, for example, by observing and interviewing users. Otherwise, you take the risk of writing speculative stories that are based on beliefs and ideas—but not on data and empirical evidence.

To check if your user story is optimal formed you can check if it fits the next criteria:
> **Independent** – they can be developed in any sequence and changes to one User Story don’t affect the others.  
> **Negotiable** – it’s up for the team to decide how to implement them; there is no rigidly fixed workflow.  
> **Valuable** – each User Story delivers a detached unit of value to end users.  
> **Estimable** – it’s quite easy to guess how much time the development of a User Story will take.  
> **Small** – it should go through the whole cycle (designing, coding, testing) during one sprint.  
> **Testable** – there should be clear acceptance criteria to check whether a User Story is implemented appropriately.
