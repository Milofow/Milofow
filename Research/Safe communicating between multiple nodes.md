# Security research regarding the communication between an amount of services or nodes.
Current semester we have to work with distributed systems, it's my first time working this way. Because I'm interested in creating safe systems, I'm going to dig into the safety while communicating between these systems. So I'm not only learning how to build distributed systems, but also learning how to secure the way they talk to each other.

## Research questions
### Main research question  
My main question that I want answered is:
* #### How to ensure a safe communication between multiple nodes/services?  

<br>

### Sub research questions
I will be answering the main question through the next sub questions:
* #### 1. What is a distributed system?
  * ##### 1.1 What is a node?
  * ##### 1.2 What is a service?
* #### 2. How do services inside a distributed systems communicate with each other?
  * ##### 2.1 What types of communication are there?(async vs sync)
  * ##### 2.2 What protocol do these services use?
  * ##### 2.3 Why do services need to be able to communicate?
* #### 3. Why is it important that communication is happening safely?
  * ##### 3.1 How to test if the communication is secured?

## DOT research methods
To make sure I get a reliable and valid outcome on this research, I used the following research methods:  

**Library:**
  * Literature study
  * Available product analysis (possible)
  * Best good and bad practices (possible)
  * Community research (possible)
  * Expert interview (possible)

**Field:**
  * Problem analysis (possible)
 
**Lab:**
  * Computer simulation (possible)
  * Data analytics (possible)
  * Security test (possible)

**Workshop:**
  * Decomposition (possible)
  * Multi-criteria decision making (possible)
