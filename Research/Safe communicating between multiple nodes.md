# Security research regarding the communication between an amount of services or nodes.
Current semester we have to work with distributed systems, it's my first time working this way. Because I'm interested in creating safe systems, I'm going to dig into the safety while communicating between these systems. So I'm not only learning how to build distributed systems, but also learning how to secure the way they talk to each other.

## Research questions
* ### How to ensure a safe communication between multiple nodes/services?  
  * #### What is a ditributed system?
    * ##### What is a node?
    * ##### What is a service?
  * #### How do distributed systems communicate with each other?
    * ##### What protocol do they use?
  * #### How to test if communication is safely happening?
  * ####
