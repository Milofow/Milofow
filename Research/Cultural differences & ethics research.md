# Cultural differences & ethics research
In this research I will discover the differences between cultures and what it means and could mean to me. But I also dive in the ethics a software engineer should or could have.

## Culture

### What is culture? 
In my opinion culture is learned behavior that is specific for your surroundings. Like the way you introduce yourself to people, eating behaviors, etc. Most of the time it's restricted to a country or specific area. 

Culture is such a broad thing that it's difficult to describe it in a few sentences and also keep it simple in this research. So I'm going to quote a definition that in my definition comes closes and describes it best. I stumbled across a piece from the book "Managing Intercultural Conflict Effectively". It says the following:

> Culture is a learned system of meanings that fosters a particular sense of shared identity and community among its group members. Members of a culture learn the
> meanings of right and wrong that produce particular consequences in a community. They learn the meanings or interpretations of what constitute proper and improper
> conflict behaviors in a particular community.

The book also has a quote from Ting-Toomey defining culture as:

> "a learned meaning system that consists of patterns of traditions, beliefs, values, norms, and symbols that are passed on from one generation to the next and are
> shared to varying degrees by interacting members of community" (Ting-Toomey, 1999 p. 10).

### Which cultural aspects would you keep in mind when facing cultural differences?
To answer this question I want to get clear what a cultural aspect is and maybe get some examples so I can start working from there.


#### What are cultural aspects?
[This answer](https://www.quora.com/What-is-an-example-of-cultural-aspects) on quora gives a good example about some aspects and also clears what it is.

The first thing that comes to my mind, is tipping. I worked as a snowboard instructor for a while and everytime I had Americans in my class they almost everytime gave me a huge tip. This differs from "us dutch people" because in our cultural it's not the norm to leave tips. I don't consider this one of the most important aspects. It could cause for an awkward situation, but you'll probably learn it fast enough, like me when experiencing such an event.







But in the end it's important to stay open minded and have good intentions while facing cultural differences. Ofcourse it comes in handy to know some aspects but you also have to get to know the culture and by doing so, you'll learn the customs and find your way in a culture just by social interactions. 

### How can cultures be clustured?


### Can you give examples for things going not as expected when interacting with people from other cultures? What and why went differently?


### What is your culture?


### How would you act in the future when you know that you need to communicate or collaborate with a person from another culture?

## Ethics

### What is ethics in software engineering?

### Why is ethics important in software engineering? 

### What do you have to do as a software engineer to address ethical aspects in your work? 

### How do you know that your ethical considerations match with those of other software engineers? 




Questions related to your project:

### Which ethical aspects play a role in your project? 
### Do you foresee ethical conflicts caused by your software? What kind of?  
### Can you do something to avoid or minimize these conflicts?
