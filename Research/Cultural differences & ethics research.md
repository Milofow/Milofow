# Cultural differences & ethics research
In this research I will discover the differences between cultures and what it means and could mean to me. But I also dive in the ethics a software engineer should or could have.

## Culture

### What is culture? 
In my opinion culture is learned behavior that is specific for your surroundings. Like the way you introduce yourself to people, eating behaviors, etc. Most of the time it's restricted to a country or specific area. 

Culture is such a broad thing that it's difficult to describe it in a few sentences and also keep it simple in this research. So I'm going to quote a definition that in my definition comes closes and describes it best. I stumbled across a piece from the book "Managing Intercultural Conflict Effectively". It says the following:

> Culture is a learned system of meanings that fosters a particular sense of shared identity and community among its group members. Members of a culture learn the
> meanings of right and wrong that produce particular consequences in a community. They learn the meanings or interpretations of what constitute proper and improper
> conflict behaviors in a particular community.

The book also has a quote from Ting-Toomey defining culture as:

> "a learned meaning system that consists of patterns of traditions, beliefs, values, norms, and symbols that are passed on from one generation to the next and are
> shared to varying degrees by interacting members of community" (Ting-Toomey, 1999 p. 10).

### Which cultural aspects would you keep in mind when facing cultural differences?
To answer this question, I want to get clear what a cultural aspect is and maybe get some examples, so I can start working from there.

#### What are cultural aspects?
[This answer](https://www.quora.com/What-is-an-example-of-cultural-aspects) on quora gives a good example about some aspects and also clears what it is.

> Culture consists of the beliefs, behaviors, objects, and other characteristics common to the members of a particular group or society. ... Thus, culture includes
> many societal aspects: language, customs, values, norms, mores, rules, tools, technologies, products, organizations, and institutions.

The first thing that comes to my mind, is tipping. I worked as a snowboard instructor for a while and everytime I had Americans in my class, they almost everytime gave me a huge tip. This differs from "us dutch people" because in our cultural it's not the norm to leave tips. I don't consider this one of the most important aspects. It could cause for an awkward situation the first time, but you will get used to it quickly. 

I think the most important aspect from the answer above is norms and morals, these are the most important aspects to keep in mind. In my opinion, I would be more suprised by someone burping while eating (in my culture it's seen as rude) than someone saying something weird.

In the end I think it's important to stay open minded and have good intentions while facing different cultures. Ofcourse it comes in handy to know some aspects but you'll also have to get to know the culture by discovering and social interactions.

### How can cultures be clustered?
To better answer this question I want to know what clustered really means. Therefore I added the question below:

#### What does cluster mean?
The cambridge dictionary says the following:
> a group of similar things that are close together, sometimes surrounding something
<i> Source: https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/cluster?q=clustered </i>

So the question is how can cultures live together in the same environment?  
This happens when people migrate to another country because of work, social life or characteristic preference of the country. A multicultural society will form out of this actions and to make it work we have to start with respecting each other's culture and treat everyone equally despite their culture.

On Quora someone asked a similair question: "What factors are needed for people from different cultures to live together peacefully?". Here is a piece of Doug Sandlin's answer:

> I’d say rule of law - where everyone in a given society is treated equally under the law.
> 
> One of the pathologies of human nature is to engage in the fallacy of imagined superiority.
> 
> If the laws of a given nation penalize it, and it’s generally socially unacceptable, to act on such misunderstanding - a generally peaceful society seems to be
> the standard result.

I think Doug has a point, the ideal situation would be if people just accepted each other. Sadly this is not always the case. Therefore I agree with Doug that the law could be a good overall means to create a safe multicultural society.

### Can you give examples for things going not as expected when interacting with people from other cultures? What and why went differently?
In my own experience I don't have examples from situations like that. But the internet has a lot; from using hand gestures that mean different things in different cultures,  to behavior that's totally normal in one culture but insulting in another one. I found this real life example, that I found interesting because it could happen to me.

> **This individual really struggles to understand the British. For example, when they prepare a report or a presentation and show it to their manager for feedback
> they are told, “it’s fine”.**
> 
> However, after handing in the report or making the presentation they discover the manager is not pleased as things are missing.
> 
> They can’t understand why they are being told something is fine, to only find out later, it is not fine. This along with other communication challenges is really
> bothering the Dutch national.
> 
> So, what’s going on here?
> 
> **Well, it’s all about how different cultures communicate. The Dutch are used to being open, frank and honest when giving opinions. If you say something is
> ‘fine’, then it’s fine.**
> 
> In the UK however, the British communication culture is very different. You need to listen to much more than the words in the UK. People say one thing but mean
> another. Saying something is “fine” in the UK really means it is not fine – it’s the exact opposite.
> 
> **Among Brits, they understand what ‘fine’ means – it means it’s 'not good enough' and that changes need to be made. The Dutch national however took the meaning
> literally – big mistake!**

### What is your culture?
First of all I grew up in the Netherlands, so I grew up with dutch culture. This means three kisses when congratulating someone, being very direct in a conversation (in the south it's a bit more nuanced), having dinner early, biking everywhere, etc. All of these don't exactly apply to me, but that has to do with my different and more worldly upbringing. Ofcourse I have some dutch culture like eating habits, short sentences that everyone says during meal time, congratulating someone, etc.

If I have to describe my culture it is more like accepting everyone around me the way they are. I try to be respectful to everyone and everything, but to also help people that might need it. I'm a people pleaser, which is a good but can also be a bad thing. I love to learn about a lot of different things including other people's culture and can admire them for it.

### How would you act in the future when you know that you need to communicate or collaborate with a person from another culture?
In the future I will try to communicate the best I can to ensure I won't get any cultural misunderstandings, like the example above and most of all give people around me the feeling that I respect their culture and it's totally okay for me and them to show their (cultural) behaviour

## Ethics

### What is ethics in software engineering?
I think ethics in software engineering are almost the same as in life. The association for computing machinery (ACM) has established a code of ethics, that shows how ethics should be applied to an (software) engineer, but also as help while making ethical decisions. The code of ethics can be found [here](acm.org/code-of-ethics).  

A short version describing this code of ethics:
> Software engineers shall commit themselves to making the analysis, specification, design, development, testing and maintenance of software a beneficial and respected
> profession. In accordance with their commitment to the health, safety and welfare of the public, software engineers shall adhere to the following Eight Principles:
> 
> 1. PUBLIC – Software engineers shall act consistently with the public interest.
> 2. CLIENT AND EMPLOYER – Software engineers shall act in a manner that is in the best interests of their client and employer consistent with the public interest.
> 3. PRODUCT – Software engineers shall ensure that their products and related modifications meet the highest professional standards possible.
> 4. JUDGMENT – Software engineers shall maintain integrity and independence in their professional judgment.
> 5. MANAGEMENT – Software engineering managers and leaders shall subscribe to and promote an ethical approach to the management of software development and maintenance.
> 6. PROFESSION – Software engineers shall advance the integrity and reputation of the profession consistent with the public interest.
> 7. COLLEAGUES – Software engineers shall be fair to and supportive of their colleagues.
> 8. SELF – Software engineers shall participate in lifelong learning regarding the practice of their profession and shall promote an ethical approach to the practice of the
> profession.

### Why is ethics important in software engineering? 
As I see it it's important that a software engineer develops with good ethics, otherwise it could be harmful for a lot of people. Because of software continuesly spreading faster, you'll affect more people than you maybe think.

I copied this piece out of an article that talks about some events that had serious consequences, which could have been avoided if it were for ethics.
> Programmers have to understand the risk of their project and failure to do so could lead bad accidents such as
> 
> - Ariane 5, Flight 501
> - Therac 25
> - The London Ambulance Service
> - Who counts the votes?
> 
> These projects are bought a massive damage on human lives...

Without going fully into detail of every incident some are confirmed incidents because of bad software engineer choices.

### What do you have to do as a software engineer to address ethical aspects in your work? 


### How do you know that your ethical considerations match with those of other software engineers? 




Questions related to your project:

### Which ethical aspects play a role in your project? 
### Do you foresee ethical conflicts caused by your software? What kind of?  
### Can you do something to avoid or minimize these conflicts?
