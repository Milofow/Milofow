# Cultural differences & ethics research

## Culture

### What is culture? 
In my opinion culture is learned behavior that is specific for your surroundings. Like the way you introduce yourself, eating behaviors, etc.



### Which cultural aspects would you keep in mind when facing cultural differences?


### How can cultures be clustured?


### Can you give examples for things going not as expected when interacting with people from other cultures? What and why went differently?


### What is your culture?


### How would you act in the future when you know that you need to communicate or collaborate with a person from another culture?
