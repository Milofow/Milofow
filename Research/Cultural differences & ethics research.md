# Cultural differences & ethics research

## Culture

### What is culture? 
In my opinion culture is learned behavior that is specific for your surroundings. Like the way you introduce yourself, eating behaviors, etc. Most of the time it's restricted to a country or area. 

Culture is such a broad thing that it's difficult to describe it in a few sentences and also keep it simple. So I'm going to quote a definition that in my definition comes closes and describes it best. I stubbled on a piece from the book "Managing Intercultural Conflict Effectively". It says the following:

> Culture is a learned system of meanings that fosters a particular sense of shared identity and community among its group members. Members of a culture learn the
> meanings of right and wrong that produce particular consequences in a community. They learn the meanings or interpretations of what constitute proper and improper
> conflict behaviors in a particular community.

The book has also a quote from Ting-Toomey defining culture as:

> "a learned meaning system that consists of patterns of traditions, beliefs, values, norms, and symbols that are passed on from one generation to the next and are
> shared to varying degrees by interacting members of community" (Ting-Toomey, 1999 p. 10).

### Which cultural aspects would you keep in mind when facing cultural differences?
To answer this question I want to clear what a cultural aspect is and maybe get some examples so I can start working from there.


#### What are cultural aspects?
[This answer](https://www.quora.com/What-is-an-example-of-cultural-aspects) on quora gives a good example about some aspects and also clears what it is.

The first thing that comes to my mind, is tipping. I worked as a snowboard instructor for a while and everytime I had Americans in my class they almost everytime left a big tip. This differs from "us dutch people" because in our cultural it's less likely to do it. I don't consider this one of the most important aspects, it could cause for an awkward situation. But you'll probably learn it fast enough, like me when experiencing such an event.







But in the end it's important to stay open minded and have good intentions while facing cultural differences, ofcourse it comes in handy to know some aspects but you also have to get to know the culture and that you can do by socializing with it.

### How can cultures be clustured?


### Can you give examples for things going not as expected when interacting with people from other cultures? What and why went differently?


### What is your culture?


### How would you act in the future when you know that you need to communicate or collaborate with a person from another culture?

Questions related to your project:

### Which ethical aspects play a role in your project? 
### Do you foresee ethical conflicts caused by your software? What kind of?
