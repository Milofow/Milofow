### Spikes

#### What is a Spike?
A spike is mostly used inside a sprint to gain (more) knowledge about a certain topic. By researching this new topic a better story estimate can be made for the future. It is mostly done at least one sprint before actual dealing with this topic.

You could divide spikes into two different types: functional and technical. the differences are explained in this article:

> <h3>Technical Spike</h3>
> The technical spike is used more often for evaluating the impact new technology has on the current implementation that the team needs experiment a new technology to gain more   > confident for a desired approach before committing new functionality to a timebox.
> 
> i.e. “how long it takes to update a customer display to current usage, determining communication requirements, bandwidth, and whether to push or pull the data”

> <h3>Functional Spike</h3>
> A functional spike are used whenever there is significant uncertainty as to how a user might interact with the system. Functional spikes are often best evaluated through some   > level of prototyping, whether it be user interface mockups, wireframes, page flows, or whatever techniques is best suited to get feedback from the customer or stakeholders.,
> 
> i.e. “Prototype a histogram in the web portal and get some user feedback on presentation size, style, and charting”
