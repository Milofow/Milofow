What does it mean agile development, the agile manifesto, the agile principles?
Which agile methods exist and which are most popular?
Can you explain Scrum in full details, as it is by the book? 
Can you explain two more agile methods and name a number of interesting features in them different from Scrum? 
Do you know how software engineers work in practice with agile methods? (to answer this question, we advise that you arrange a visit to a company)
Which agile management tool would you recommend for use in your project and why?   




# Agile Methods

## Kanban

Kanban is a way of organising your tasks on a board. The simplest form is to divide your tasks into three stages: to do, in progress and done. This way you can get a good overview in just a glance. 

## Scrum

## Extreme programming (XP)

Extreme programming has some different aspects, a few are listed below.

### Spikes

#### What is a Spike?
A spike is mostly used inside a sprint to gain (more) knowledge about a certain topic. By researching this new topic a better story estimate can be made for the future. It is mostly done at least one sprint before actual dealing with this topic. By using spikes you can minimal the risk of overestimating a user story or specific task in a project.

Side note why it's called like this:

> The word spike comes from rock climbing activities. While climbing, we might stop to force a spike into the rock face, which is not actual climbing but by doing this we are   > making sure that future climbing will be smooth and easy.

You could divide spikes into two different types: functional and technical. the differences are explained in this article:

> <h3>Technical Spike</h3>
> The technical spike is used more often for evaluating the impact new technology has on the current implementation that the team needs experiment a new technology to gain more   > confident for a desired approach before committing new functionality to a timebox.
> 
> i.e. “how long it takes to update a customer display to current usage, determining communication requirements, bandwidth, and whether to push or pull the data”

> <h3>Functional Spike</h3>
> A functional spike are used whenever there is significant uncertainty as to how a user might interact with the system. Functional spikes are often best evaluated through some   > level of prototyping, whether it be user interface mockups, wireframes, page flows, or whatever techniques is best suited to get feedback from the customer or stakeholders.,
> 
> i.e. “Prototype a histogram in the web portal and get some user feedback on presentation size, style, and charting”

Where a spike differs from a user story is the time estimated for a spike is all it gets after that time it's done. A user story on the other hand is only finished when the user story is implemented in the application.


The acceptance criteria of a spike is further explained in the same article:

> Just like any other ordinary user story, they need fulfil some certain criteria to obtain the status of done by making sure that the “Spike Story” estimable, demonstrable, and > acceptable:
>
> Estimable
>
> Like other stories, spikes are put in the backlog, estimable and sized to fit in an iteration. Spike results are different from a story, as they generally produce information, > rather than working code. A spike may result in a decision, a prototype, storyboard, proof of concept, or some other partial solution to help drive the final results.
>
> In any case, the spike should develop just the information sufficient to resolve the uncertainty in being able to identify and size the stories hidden beneath the spike.
> 
> Demonstrable
> 
> The output of a spike is demonstrable to the team. This brings visibility to the research and architectural efforts and also helps build collective ownership and shared       > responsibility for the key decisions that are being taken.
> 
> Acceptable
> 
> And like any other story, spikes are accepted by the product owner when the acceptance criteria for the spike have been fulfilled.
