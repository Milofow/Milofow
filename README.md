# Portfolio Milo Timmermans

## Introduction
I'm Milo Timmermans and I'm currently studying ICT software engineering at Fontys Hogescholen. This is my beginning of my personal portfolio, that's gonna start with some learning outcomes that I'll have to proof to complete semester 3 of my study. The learning outcomes that need to be achieved are listed below and overtime will be expanded.








## Learning Outcomes
To define my learning outcomes this semester, I will be using a project to prove them. The project is a dashboard to control some smart home devices and can be found [here](https://github.com/Milofow/Home-automation-dashboard)

### You design and build user-friendly, full-stack web applications.

This learning outcomes exists of three subjects to fulfill: a front-end, a back-end, a ux research and design with implementation.

#### Front-end
I've chosen to get to know the React framework to create my front-end. I've chosen React because it's a popular framework and a lot of my peers are currently working with it, which makes asking for help a lot easier.



#### Back-end
Previous semester I worked with C# language for the back-end, because I like to know a bit of everything I've chosen to work with another language that is Java. My next search was for a good framework and I stranded with the popular Spring framework.


##### Auth0
I first started off with a login system for my project. I used Auth0 as it works very well and is easy to implement, because of it's good documentation.



##### MQTT
Here I build a simple form for sending a message to services subscribed to the topic 'presence'. I'm using websockets to send the data to the MQTT broker and it sends it back to the console. The MQTT broker I'm using is Mosquitto.

##### Devices service
To save some details about each device I needed a database to store this info in. Because this semester is about distributed systems I created a separate API service for handling this. 

API Paths:
GET: ```/devices/```
GET: ```/devices/{id}```
POST: ```/devices/new```
PUT: ```/devices/{id}```
DELETE: ```/devices/{id}```



##### Database ORM
##### Communication Protocols


#### UX



### You use software tooling and methodology that continuously monitors and improve the software quality during software development.

#### Integration testing
#### Unit testing
#### Acceptation testing

#### Code review with issue

```Insert proof of concept(s)```

### You design and implement a (semi)automated software release process that matches the needs of the project context.

#### Branches on pull and push testing and deployment

```Insert proof of concept(s)```

### You act in a professional manner during software development and learning.

#### Architecture
```Insert proof of concept(s)```
