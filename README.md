# Portfolio Milo Timmermans

## Introduction
I'm Milo Timmermans and I'm currently studying ICT software engineering at Fontys Hogescholen. This is my beginning of my personal portfolio, that's gonna start with some learning outcomes that I'll have to proof to complete semester 3 of my study. The learning outcomes that need to be achieved are listed below and overtime will be expanded.




## Start of the project

#### C4

#### Front-end
I've chosen to get to know the React framework to create my front-end. I've chosen React because it's a popular framework and a lot of my peers are currently working with it, which makes asking for help a lot easier.



#### Back-end
Previous semester I worked with C# language for the back-end, because I like to know a bit of everything I've chosen to work with another language that is Java. My next search was for a good framework and I stranded with the popular Spring framework.






## Learning Outcomes

### Outcome 1. You design and build user-friendly, full-stack web applications.

This learning outcomes exists of three subjects to fulfill: a front-end, a back-end, a ux research and design with implementation.

##### 1. Identity service: Login, Register and account information service with 0Auth2
I first started off with a login system for my project. I used Auth0 as it works very well and is easy to implement, because of it's good documentation.

##### 2. MQTT
Here I build a simple form for sending a message to services subscribed to the topic 'presence'. I'm using websockets to send the data to the MQTT broker and it sends it back to the console. The MQTT broker I'm using is Mosquitto.

##### 3. API Devices service
Because this semester is about distributed systems I created a separate API service for handling this which can be found [here](https://github.com/Milofow/devices-service)
