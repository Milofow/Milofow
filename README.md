### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m studying ICT software engineering and currently doing a specialisation in smart mobile 
     with topics regarding native app development (PWA, iOS and Android), but also design thinking (UX, IX, HCD, etc.)



I've started gathering knowledge about certain topics that interest me or during my school period.

- [Ones that are finished]()
