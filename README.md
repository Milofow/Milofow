# Portfolio Milo Timmermans

## Introduction
I'm Milo Timmermans and I'm currently studying ICT software engineering at Fontys Hogescholen. This is my beginning of my personal portfolio, that's gonna start with some learning outcomes that I'll have to proof to complete semester 3 of my study. The learning outcomes that need to be achieved are listed below and overtime will be expanded.








## Learning Outcomes
