# Portfolio Milo Timmermans

## Introduction
I'm Milo Timmermans and I'm currently studying ICT software engineering at Fontys Hogescholen. This is my beginning of my personal portfolio, that's gonna start with some learning outcomes that I'll have to proof to complete semester 3 of my study. The learning outcomes that need to be achieved are listed below and overtime will be expanded.




## Start of the project
To help me prove some of the learning outcomes I'll be making a project. It will be a IoT dashboard, more information can be found in its repo [here](https://github.com/Milofow/front-end-dashboard)

#### C4

#### Front-end
I've chosen to get to know the React framework to create my front-end. I've chosen React because it's a popular framework and a lot of my peers are currently working with it, which makes asking for help a lot easier.



#### Back-end
Previous semester I worked with C# language for the back-end, because I like to know a bit of everything I've chosen Java for my backend, due to Java being a new language for me. My next search was for a good framework and I stranded with the popular Spring framework. We had a workshop about Java frameworks and the host was very excited about Spring, his excitement was contagious.






## Learning Outcomes

### Outcome 1. You design and build user-friendly, full-stack web applications.

##### 1. Identity service: Login, Register and account information service with 0Auth2
I first started off with a login system for my project. I used Auth0 as it works very well and is easy to implement, because of it's good documentation.

##### 2. MQTT
Here I build a simple form for sending a message to services subscribed to the topic 'presence', to get a little bit known with how mqtt works. I'm using websockets to send the data to the MQTT broker and it sends it back to the console. The MQTT broker I'm using is Mosquitto.

##### 3. API Devices service
Because this semester is about distributed systems I created a separate API service for handling this which can be found [here](https://github.com/Milofow/devices-service)

##### 4. Discovery service
Because I was following JavaBrains's course, I created a discovery service that detects running services. This could come in handy if I was using more or back up services.





I did not implement the discovery service later on, because my circumstances did not ask for a discovery service, thus being needless.

### Outcome 2. You use software tooling and methodology that continuously monitors and improve the software quality during software development.

#### 1. Unit and integration testing

Sources:

#### 2. Automated tests on push

Sources:

#### 3. Testing with H2 database

Sources:

#### 4. Exception testing

Sources:

#### 5. Code review


### Outcome 3. You design and implement a (semi)automated software release process that matches the needs of the project context.

#### 1. Docker containers

Sources:

#### 2. Deploy web services

Sources:

### Outcome 4. You act in a professional manner during software development and learning.

#### 1. Project board
To start working more user story oriented I started a project board on Github. Mainly being the reason I needed some planning and what better place to do it, where my project was living, Github. I put all my user story with a short text on it, so I can start working from there. I use this board with the front end repo aswell as the back end repo.

#### 2. Github flow
To work a little bit more professional, as a preparation for the future. I try working with the so called Github flow. This means having seperate branches, for seperate stages in your project. Because the project isn't to big I will be working with the flow as it's explained in the picture below:
