# From user story to release
In this document I will be showing a work process that is centered around a user story.

## User story
First I'm going to create a user story that is related to my application. I'm going to create a simple one, like showing all my devices when I login.
<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <td><b>Title:</b> <br>1. Overview of my devices</td>
      <td><b>Priority:</b> <br> 5/5</td>
      <td><b>Estimate:</b> <br> 3h</td>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td colspan="3">
        <b>User Story:</b><br> 
        <b>As</b> a smart home owner, <br>
        <b>I want</b> to see all my devices grouped together on a dashboard, <br>
        <b>so that</b> I can control them more easily.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td colspan="3">
        <b>Acceptance Criteria:</b><br>
          <ul>
            <li>I only want to access my devices after I'm logged in</li>
            <li>I want to see the device's name</li>
            <li>I want to see the device's status</li>
            <li>I want to be able to control them from this overview</li>
          </ul>
        </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>



## Project board
When I'm finished with the user story I'm going to create issues related to that user story. I need to fulfill these issues to come closer to implementing the user story. I like to put the issues on the project board on Github. In the end it'll look like this:


## Implement


### Feature branch


## Testing




## Release
### Pull request
