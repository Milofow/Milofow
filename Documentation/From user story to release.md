# From user story to release
In this document I will be showing a work process that is centered around a user story.

## User story
First I'm going to create a user story that is related to my application. I'm going to create a simple one, like showing all my devices when I login.
<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <td><b>Title:</b> <br>1. Overview of my devices</td>
      <td><b>Priority:</b> <br> 5/5</td>
      <td><b>Estimate:</b> <br></td>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td colspan="3">
        <b>User Story:</b><br> 
        As a smart home owner,
        I want to see all my devices together on a dashboard
        so that .</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td colspan="3">
        <b>Acceptance Criteria:</b><br>
          <ul>
            <li></li>
          </ul>
        </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
