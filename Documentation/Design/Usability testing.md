# Usability testing
When you started creating prototypes it's good to test the usability of them to prevent making mistakes later on. 
This kind of testing helps to solve problems in navigation or the user flow by letting people test if the app is clear to work with.




## Heuristic evaluation
It's a good thing to do a heuristic evaluation first, because that way you can prevent people stumbling on these problems while testing 
with real people and leaves space for more important feedback. A heuristic evaluation is a couple of guidelines to help you check your usability 
of your app. The best way to do this is to let so called usability experts do this.
