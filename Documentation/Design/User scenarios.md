> On a more practical side, a user scenario tends to include who the user is and what their goal is at that moment. 
> Generally, scenarios are concise and represent a snapshot of the user experience.

> User Scenarios are useful for designers because they can spark ideas, generate features and help refine any requirements going forward. 
> They are also crucial when it comes to usability testing. With user scenarios and a professional wireframe tool, designers can make sure 
> they cover all their bases and validate every move users make in the product.

> A user scenario simply describes a basic story of an action or goal that a user wants to accomplish. 
> It might be how Kevin needs to buy a CD online for delivery today for his friend’s birthday, for example. 
> Of course, scenarios can be much more detailed too the idea is to work out the: who, what, when, where, why and how of the user’s scenario.

> Scenario mapping can be effective at many points during a project but there are three great uses for it at specific stages:
> 
> Ideation – if you’re trying to create a new product, then having scenario maps makes it very easy to explore ideas with your team and with users. It also helps, in a similar means to task analysis, formulate a shared vision for the project. (See the method below as to how to do this).
> Iteration – if you’re new to a product and you’re going to be involved in creating future iterations then it’s pretty easy to create scenario maps “on the fly” by observing users with the current product. (This can be done solo and doesn’t need the method below).
> Usability testing – user scenarios can also be used to define which are the most important areas to test during usability testing and to provide guidance on how it should be done.

To kickstart creating these user scenarios you can use a method called user scenario mapping, more can be found [here](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/design-scenarios-communicating-the-small-steps-in-the-user-experience)
