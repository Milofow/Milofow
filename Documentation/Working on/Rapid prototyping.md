# Rapid prototyping
To waste as little time and money on validating your prototype something called rapid prototyping was invented. 
The course of creating very much yet small and very low fidelity prototypes to test on your users.


A way to come up with prototypes is the crazy 8s method

> A well-known rapid ideation technique, crazy 8s helps designers brew eight ideas in a short window of time. 
> And while it might seem as if those ideas are undeveloped and rushed (which is true), the process of sketching raw thoughts 
> as they arise often results in exceptional solutions that wouldn’t normally be discovered.
>
> Here’s how it works:
> 
> Gather notes/research (20 minutes)
> Doodle rough ideas (20 minutes)
> Sketch eight ideas you’re confident about (eight minutes)
> Choose the best idea, and turn it into a short storyboard (30+ minutes)
> You can use your storyboard to prototype your idea.
