# Prototyping

## Rapid prototyping
To waste as little time and money on validating your prototype something called rapid prototyping was invented. 
The course of creating very much yet small and very low fidelity prototypes to test on your users.


A way to come up with prototypes is the crazy 8s method

> A well-known rapid ideation technique, crazy 8s helps designers brew eight ideas in a short window of time. 
> And while it might seem as if those ideas are undeveloped and rushed (which is true), the process of sketching raw thoughts 
> as they arise often results in exceptional solutions that wouldn’t normally be discovered.
>
> Here’s how it works:
> 
> Gather notes/research (20 minutes)
> Doodle rough ideas (20 minutes)
> Sketch eight ideas you’re confident about (eight minutes)
> Choose the best idea, and turn it into a short storyboard (30+ minutes)
> You can use your storyboard to prototype your idea.

an easy way to do rapid prototyping is to do paper prototyping, it's cost efficient fast and everyone can do it. Because paper prototypes normally look sketchy users tend to give more honest opinions because it's just a sketch. Paper prototyping is just drawing prototypes with some paper and a pen or maybe create one a little advance with doing some cutting en sticking parts together.


if you go the testing bit let one person be "the computer" and one the interviewer. Being the computer means this person only handles the appropriate screens that a user requests or not.
